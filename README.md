# The Digital Jazz Lexicon

Welcome to The Digital Jazz Lexicon, a curated digital humanities project that explores the vibrant intersection of jazz music and everyday language. This repository serves as a living archive of jazz slang—terms that originated in the swing and bebop eras and later seeped into the broader cultural consciousness. Our goal is not only to define these colorful expressions but also to trace their migration from the bandstand to the printed page, highlighting how jazz vernacular shaped the voice of 20th‑century literature and poetry.

Jazz has always been more than just a musical genre; it is a cultural force that gave rise to a unique lexicon. Words like “cat,” “dig,” “cool,” and “hip” were born in smoky clubs and recording studios, yet they quickly found their way into the works of Beat poets, modernist novelists, and even mainstream journalism. By documenting these terms alongside their literary appearances, we aim to illustrate how the language of jazz became a powerful tool for writers who sought to capture the rhythm, spontaneity, and rebellious spirit of the age.

This project is built on GitHub to embrace both version‑control and collaborative practices. Each entry in the lexicon follows a consistent format that includes the term’s definition, its predominant era, and an illustrative excerpt from a poem, novel, or play. We invite contributors to expand the collection, propose new examples, and engage in discussions about the cultural contexts that gave these words their enduring resonance. Whether you are a jazz aficionado, a literature student, or simply curious about linguistic cross‑pollination, we hope you’ll dig this journey through the sounds and syllables of America’s quintessential art form.
